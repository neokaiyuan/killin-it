            <h1>Introduction:</h1>

            <p>Our motivation is that note-taking in reading classes is redundant. Notetaking is a time consuming process, and many people take similar notes. It would be more efficient for everyone to take notes on the same document, such that everyone would be able to benefit from each other without face to face communication.</p>

            <p>The goal is to simplify the group reading process by allowing everyone to share the same copy of a text. This would a) reduce redundancy in note taking, and b) provide people long-lasting notes and memories of their discussions</p>

            <h1>Methods:</h1>

            <h1>Discussion:</h1>

            <p>Our interviews were structured to obtain two kinds of information: information about app usage, as well as current practices in note taking and class discussion. The goal of this distinction was to obtain detailed information about app-specific issues, as well as high-level information about how we can adapt our app to integrate into current behavior.</p>

            <p>We wish to elicit higher quantity and quality of responses in our next iteration. We measure quantity by the number of times an individual posts, and approximate quality by the length of her recording.</p>

            <p>Through our interviews, we aimed to have interviewees describe conditions that would encourage them to post more. From there, we chose to focus on three themes:</p>

            <h3>1. Privacy</h3>

            <p>Most interviewees established a difference between private and public ideas. They often had a different platform for recording private thoughts (notebooks, Tumblr), while their public ideas are shared with the rest of their section on Google Docs and forum posts. Since any videos posted on ReadWithMe are currently public, some interviewees expressed reservations about recording "not well-formed thoughts". By allowing private videos, we can boost the quantity of posts.</p>

            <h3>2. Role of the instructors</h3>

            <p>Our interviewees have generally expressed that the largest contributing factor toward their understanding of the text is the instructor. In humanities class, instructors can be either section leaders or lecturers. To successfully engage with the text, it is important to have the instructor involved. In addition, most interviewees expressed that their pattern of discussion in section is usually prompted by a question from the section leader. By having the section leader highlight and annotate important parts of the text, we could boost both the quantity and quality of responses.</p>

            <h3>3.  Structuring annotations</h3>

            <p>Most of our interviewees noted that their discussions are usually organized around themes or concepts. They find it easier to focus their thoughts on specific subjects, for example, in the case of this week’s reading (Hannah Arendt), "totalitarianism" or “the human condition”. Conversely, our interviewees also understand others comments better if they are similarly rooted within the same framework. They find it more productive when discussions are structured. By structuring annotations in the forms of tags or threads, we may be able to focus discussion better and elicit more high quality responses.</p>

            <h1>Implications:</h1>

            <p>Our results and discussion section have outlined some modifications we will apply to our next iteration. We have split them into two categories: user-interface and user-experience. User-interface changes concern mainly the immediate feedback and observations that we have received from our users, while user-experience changes are based on our discussions on how we can utilize current practices to improve app.</p>

            <h3>User-interface</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Delete a video that you have recorded</p></li>
                <li><p>PDF jumps to top of page while next is clicked</p></li>
                <li><p>Stop video while playing</p></li>
                <li><p>Video plays on right margin</p></li>
            </ol>


            <h3>User-experience</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Integrate instructors into the system</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>Instructor videos are uniquely identified by icon</p></li>
                    <li><p>Instructors can prompt responses by text annotations</p></li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li><p>Establish privacy</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>Facebook login to authenticate identity</p></li>
                    <li><p>Posts can be private, viewable only by a select group, or public</p></li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li><p>Structuring annotations</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>Implement threading system</p></li>
                    <li><p>Videos can be tagged according to topics (set by the instructor)</p></li>
                </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
